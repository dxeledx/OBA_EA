# Paper assets (figures & tables)

This folder contains **paper-ready** tables/figures exported from reproducible runs under `outputs/`.

Conventions:
- Each subfolder records its source run(s) in a `SOURCES.md` file.
- Figures are saved as `.png` (300 dpi) and, when convenient, `.pdf`.
- Tables are saved as `.csv` plus a `.md` preview for quick copy into manuscripts.
